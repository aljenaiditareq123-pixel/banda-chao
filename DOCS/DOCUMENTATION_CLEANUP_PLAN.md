# 🧹 Documentation Cleanup Plan

**Status:** Proposed (Not Executed)  
**Purpose:** Clean up old/duplicate documentation files  
**Safety:** Review before deletion

---

## 📊 Current Situation

- **Total MD files in root:** 107 files
- **Many are:** Old reports, summaries, fix documents
- **Risk:** Clutter, confusion, outdated information

---

## 🎯 Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Archive Old Reports (Safe)
Move old reports to `DOCS/ARCHIVE/` folder:
- `*_REPORT.md` files older than 3 months
- `*_SUMMARY.md` files for completed phases
- `*_FIX*.md` files for resolved issues

### Phase 2: Consolidate Documentation
Keep only current/important docs in root:
- `README.md` ✅
- `FIRST_3_STEPS_LAUNCH.md` ✅
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` ✅
- Active guides only

### Phase 3: Organize by Category
Move to `DOCS/` folder:
- Setup guides
- API documentation
- Deployment guides
- Testing guides

## ⚠️ Safety First

**Before any deletion:**
1. Review each file
2. Check if still referenced
3. Archive instead of delete
4. Keep important historical records

**This cleanup will be done carefully and incrementally.**
